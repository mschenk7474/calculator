# Overview

This project was designed to be a good beginner project in Java to help me understand the basics of Java Syntax and the Object-Oriented aspects of the Language. I chose to create a calculator because it exposed me to different libraries in Java and allowed me to fully understand the data structures that I was learning about.

As previously mentioned, I have created a calculator using Java in the command line that allows the user to choose from the basic operations such as add, subtract, multiply and divide or from some higher math functions such as square root and absolute value. On every option from the main menu, there is a mini menu with different options the user can choose from that suits their needs more efficiently. There is also functionality present in the program to show or clear the total, or to see those totals that you calculated before as well.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  The focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
